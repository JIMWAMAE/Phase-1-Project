# Phase-1-Project
## Jimcollins wamae Phase 1 project(Microsoft Movie studio EDA).
### Introduction
As a data scientist I have been given a task by Microsoft Movie studios to analize given datasets so as to generate insights on what type of films to create. We are going to do an exploratory data analysis on the data provided from the movies box office.
### Objectives 
1. Effect of runtime minutes on movie average rating.
2. What are the top perfoming movie genres according to genres average ratings?
3. Effect of directors and writters selection towards movie success.
4. What is the correlation between budget and  revenue generated for a given movie?
### Business Understanding
Microsoft is a start up business in the movie industry .They sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. We will conduct an exploratory data analysis so as to explore what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. We will then translate our findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.
### Data Understanding
We have been provided with various data sets for the study. This section will give us an overview of the data we will use to genrate our insights. From this given data we will generate insights so as to advice the company.
1. The first data set we will use is the im.db database (https://github.com/JIMWAMAE/dsc-phase-1-project-v2-4/blob/master/zippedData/im.db) whose erd is shown below. It will give us data that relates to the movie genres and ratings from the tables movie_basics and movie_ratings. We will use the persons table and the directors to generate isight about director perfomance as well as writter perfomances.
2. The second data set is the movie budget csv file(https://github.com/JIMWAMAE/dsc-phase-1-project-v2-4/blob/master/zippedData/im.db) that will help us visualize revenue generated as well as the budget allocated for the movies.
